# My first Noita mod

I've been sinking some hours into Noita for the past couple of weeks and I started looking into mods for the game.
After reading through the basics on the [Noita Wiki Modding Basics](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Modding) I wanted to try my hand at modding.

This will just be me messing around with the files to test and see what I can do with the tools NÃ¸lla has provided us with. ***This is the first time I'm modding a game, please be nice***

## Here is a list of resources that I use:

- [Noita Wiki: Modding](https://noita.wiki.gg/wiki/Modding)
- [Aseprite for Pixel Art](https://www.aseprite.org/)
- [Steam Workshop for Noita](https://steamcommunity.com/app/881100/workshop/)
